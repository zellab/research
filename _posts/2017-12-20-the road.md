A road to nowhere? Its the road to the the future or a road in the future to be exact.

This is an artistic interpretation of a future Road network system. The roads will look like the usual ones we have today. The difference is in the Road network itself. Shifting junctions based on time and date, vehicle counters and trackers, single lane system to avoid collisions and many more.

Its obvious that the future will have automatic transports, self-driving cars which are smart enough to provide a safe and faster means of transportation. What if the roads get smart too?
